# Contributing to YAJA

Keep changes focused and explain the problem they solve. Discuss architectural
changes in an issue before implementing them. Follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

The [project procedure index](docs/procedures/README.md) lists SOPs, their scope,
approval status, and enforcement coverage. Follow approved procedures applicable
to your change. Proposed procedures remain proposals until explicitly approved.

## Setup and testing

Follow the [development setup](README.md#development-setup), then run:

```text
python scripts/verify.py
```

Use `python scripts/verify.py --pure` when working on pure logic without the
development services. Integration changes need the full suite against running
services. See [the testing guide](docs/TESTING.md) for coverage and limitations.

Add tests for changed behavior and relevant failure cases. Update documentation
when commands, contracts, or supported behavior change. Run `cargo fmt --all`
and `gofmt` on changed Rust and Go files.

Pure Rust code lives in `src/pure/` and adapters in `src/io/`. Go uses `go/pure/`
and `go/io/`. Add new Go modules to `go.work` and the test runner.

## Pull requests and review

Describe the resulting behavior, tests run, and any remaining limitations.
Include relevant service versions and results for integration changes. Keep
credentials, local environment files, and unrelated changes out of the PR.

The local commit hook tests staged source files in an isolated directory. Stage
test fixes before retrying a failed commit. CI runs the full suite for pull
requests and pushes to `main`.

Changes to `main` require passing CI. During the sole-contributor phase, an
independent approving PR review is optional. Before merging, the maintainer
inspects the final change, test evidence, and applicable procedure requirements
and records that assessment in the PR. Give particular attention to architecture,
dependencies, CI, and test coverage. Self-assessment is not an independent GitHub
approval. Ownership is recorded in `.github/CODEOWNERS`; code-owner approval is
not a required merge condition in this phase. Reconsider mandatory independent
review when another reviewer is available.
