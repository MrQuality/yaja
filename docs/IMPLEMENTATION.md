# Implementation status

The [engineering standard](engineering/ENGINEERING-STANDARD.md) assesses Kehila as
E0 Experimental, independently of product delivery milestones. The register and
its generated document are checked in shared verification; Go formatting/vet
join the current CI baseline. These controls do not add supported product,
authentication, recovery or release capabilities, or broaden existing evidence.

Kehila is in early development. The current components are:

[ADR-102](architecture/ADR-102-postgresql-transactions.md) records the accepted
native PostgreSQL/JSONB and bounded-transaction direction for new M1 storage.
The running task worker and development stack still use FerretDB. The
[native storage foundation](../storage/postgresql/README.md) provides a fresh
version-one installer, structural integrity guards and restricted creation roles.
No native application adapter, legacy-data migration, or supported
configurable-model persistence path is implemented.

The isolated [SP-001 experiment](spikes/SP-001-task-path.md) also exercised a
small task save/CDC/search path with Python boundary adapters on Windows/Podman.
Its six cases passed with constrained memory after configuring PostgreSQL replica
identity and a task-only publication. This prototype is retained for reproduction.
The newer Go/Rust work covers only the API-to-worker mutation/read boundary so far;
it does not yet provide the production CDC/search path or supported installation.

## Current limitations

The Rust NATS component is a synchronous connection probe. Publishing,
acknowledgment, and replay are not implemented in that component. The new task
worker uses external crates for its FerretDB adapter and HTTP boundary.

The Compose services are for local development. PostgreSQL enables logical WAL,
but that development stack has no replication slot or CDC connector. FerretDB runs as a standalone
proxy. TCP readiness does not establish query correctness.

The Go test helper preserves test exit status and retries temporary-directory
cleanup for up to 30 seconds to handle Windows executable file locks. Failed
tests are not retried.

## Planned work

The [product plan](product/README.md) adds the agreed product
requirements, design rationale, open questions, and a proposed delivery backlog.
Use [that backlog](product/backlog.md) to trace product work to requirements;
the technical work below remains part of the existing architecture reference.
Documented requirements and planned backlog items are not implemented features.

- Full query grammar, OpenSearch and Rhai emitters, and Wasm bindings.
- Connect the typed domain rules to authoritative schema state and mutation paths.
- Sagas, the production CDC-to-Rust-indexer path, and idempotent search projections.
- Go authentication, full API routes, and SSE delivery.
- React UI, optimistic state, and reconciliation.
- Recovery and crash-isolation integration tests.

The [v0.2 design](reference/Kehila-v0.2.md) now reflects the accepted
[first-increment save contract](product/decisions.md#d-016): an acknowledged task
action returns 200 and a persisted version independently of search visibility.
The first Go/Rust mutation/read slice is implemented, but its operation-record
retention/compaction, installation and replication readiness, authenticated access,
and production indexing remain incomplete.

## Task-path implementation in progress

The [accepted direction](product/decisions.md#d-016) requires atomic mutation and
successful-operation recording. FerretDB v1.24 does not support multi-document
transactions, so the current Rust worker stores each successful task mutation and
its result as one immutable operation document. Its `_id` is the task/version pair;
a unique task/operation-ID index rejects reuse. A bounded local service check
verified both uniqueness constraints and latest-version lookup. This is a new
mapping, separate from the SP-001 Python fixture, and its physical PostgreSQL
table has not yet been provisioned for CDC.

The worker uses provisional, internally configurable 90-day limits for admitting
an unseen UUIDv7 operation ID and replaying a recorded success after server commit.
Each attempt reads the current version and then looks up the operation record;
only then does it decide replay, admission, validation, or version conflict. This
ordering recognizes an identical concurrent success before rejecting its version;
unique insert conflicts reload both observations. The pure task-contract function
owns replay comparison, task validation, version conflict, and next-version rules.
It compares decoded typed fields rather than JSON byte order, returns
the original successful version for an identical replay, rejects changed-content
reuse, and rejects expired IDs rather than executing them again. Rejected attempts
are not retained. Old operation records are not yet compacted, so physical
retention and the separate product-history policy remain unfinished.
The worker also lacks replication-readiness verification and separate supported
installation credentials. Its current index-install command is a development
setup aid; it does not establish production provisioning.

The Go API defaults to loopback and enforces same-origin browser mutations. It
keeps database-backed reads available when search is down. Its projection route
now checks an actual OpenSearch query and refuses a result older than the
requested saved version. A live Go-to-Python experiment check passed with the
search projection running; a separate live Go-to-Rust check passed with search
deliberately stopped. These checks do not validate the production indexer, CDC, browser UI,
authenticated access, or post-crash durability. The current missing-Origin policy
is not a supported browser-session CSRF contract.

## Worker boundary and execution limits

The internal Rust HTTP listener rejects non-loopback bind addresses, unexpected
Host headers, and requests carrying Origin or Sec-Fetch-Site. Mutations require
`application/json`. Go constructs fresh upstream requests; it does not forward
browser context headers. Direct CLI probes may omit browser headers. This is a
transport boundary for disposable development, not owner authentication.

The worker uses the asynchronous MongoDB driver and Axum on two runtime threads,
with at most 16 active requests, eight in-flight storage operations, and eight
database pool connections. Excess HTTP requests receive 503 `worker_busy`; request bodies are limited to 4096 bytes and
three seconds. Waiting for a storage result has a four-second deadline; all
admitted HTTP handlers, including reads and health, have a five-second deadline. Database
connection and server-selection timeouts are two seconds. Timeout responses do
not prove that a write was rejected: reconcile an uncertain outcome using the
same operation ID. MongoDB 2.x driver futures run to completion in separate tasks;
a timed-out caller releases its HTTP handler but the storage task retains its capacity permit
until completion. This avoids unsafe driver cancellation and unbounded abandoned
work. No further mutation command is started after its deadline, but a command
already sent may still commit. A fully stalled pool rejects further storage work
promptly until the dependency recovers; deadlines do not forcibly cancel server
work. These are development limits, not measured product SLOs.

The default full verification suite now launches independent workers against
real FerretDB and checks concurrency, direct access rejection, stalled bodies,
database transport stalls/recovery, and Go-to-Rust behavior with search down.
See [required retesting](TESTING.md#required-retesting-after-task-path-changes).

Local regression evidence (2026-09-29): the full verification suite and pure
suite passed on Windows/Podman with PostgreSQL 16.13, FerretDB 1.24.2, NATS
2.10.26, and OpenSearch 2.19.1. The full run included all 48 cross-process
contention pairs, worker boundary checks, stalled body and database recovery,
and the Go-to-Rust search-outage case. SP-001 C01-C06 were not rerun: their
Python adapters, mapping, CDC configuration, and projection were unchanged.

## Startup configuration migration

The task API and mutation worker reject recognized environment-variable names
from before the Kehila rename before connecting to a database or binding an HTTP
listener. This includes the worker's `install-indexes` and
`drop-test-collection` commands. A retired key is rejected when present even if
its value is empty or its current replacement is also set. The diagnostic names
the first retired key in a fixed order and its `KEHILA_*` replacement; it does
not print configuration values. Remove retired keys rather than setting them to
empty strings. No compatibility aliases are read.

The API checks former names corresponding to `KEHILA_WORKER_URL`,
`KEHILA_SEARCH_URL`, and `KEHILA_LISTEN_ADDR`. The worker checks former names
corresponding to `KEHILA_MONGO_URL`, `KEHILA_TASK_DB`,
`KEHILA_TASK_COLLECTION`, `KEHILA_OPERATION_ADMISSION_DAYS`,
`KEHILA_OPERATION_REPLAY_DAYS`, and `KEHILA_WORKER_LISTEN_ADDR`. Each component
ignores unrelated names, including former-prefix settings owned by other
components. Current setting parsing and defaults, including retained storage
identities, are unchanged. See the [rename policy](BRANDING.md) for migration
names and retained storage identities.

These guards do not cover probe and test-harness settings corresponding to
`KEHILA_API_URL`, `KEHILA_NATS_ADDRESS`, `KEHILA_NATS_HOST`, `KEHILA_NATS_PORT`,
or `KEHILA_TEST_MONGO_URL`. Their former-prefix keys remain ignored. When a
current replacement is absent, a stale key can select the localhost default and
run checks against an unintended available instance. Broader configuration
validation remains [B-027](product/backlog.md#b-027).

Subprocess tests exercise each rejected key, empty values, old/new conflicts,
all worker command modes, sanitized diagnostics, and deterministic first-error
selection. A local TCP probe verifies that rejected worker startup makes no
database connection. These tests require no running development services;
existing live tests cover startup with current configuration and persistence.
