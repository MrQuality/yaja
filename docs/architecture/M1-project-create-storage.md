# M1 project creation: storage specification

Status: Storage foundation implemented locally, 2026-10-10. Scope: #26/B-005 with #27 and #11/#32.
The executable fresh baseline is in [storage/postgresql](../../storage/postgresql/README.md).
The SQL below explains the design; installation uses the executable files.
The unchanged SQL at baseline 9f433f9 was executed in
[SP-002](../spikes/SP-002-postgresql-project-create.md). The bounded tests found
a privileged payload-identity move gap; the executable baseline includes the
identity guard shown below. The frozen experiment remains unchanged.
[ADR-102](ADR-102-postgresql-transactions.md)
accepts the storage direction; it does not approve the physical choices below.
The typed-target layout below replaces the project-only key sketch. Its physical
columns implement the agreed target-scope correction for the creation foundation.

## Outcome and boundary

One accepted creation saves the Project, trusted M1V1 Configuration, immutable
revision-one history, initial access, and successful request result in one
transaction. The existing experimental worker remains unchanged.

The [seed/history tables](M1-project-create-seed.md) continue this SQL. Read both
documents as one schema explanation; neither Markdown fragment is an installer.
The [command and verification proposal](M1-project-create-protocol.md) defines
the locking, retry, privilege, and evidence requirements for this slice.

The schema is split into the permanent request core and an expiring payload.
Deleting payload must never remove the request's unique identity. Product history
references that permanent core, not the replay payload. Full replay retains exact
typed request comparison; a digest is not a substitute for it.

## Choices and remaining application gates

The [local implementation plan](../implementation/issue-26-postgresql-foundation.md)
records the selected native representation boundary. Foundation installation
does not complete the application acceptance obligations in the table below.

| ID | Proposal | Acceptance boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P-01 | Opaque IDs use UTF8 text with C collation and a 128-byte limit. | A new bound on several String-backed IDs; must be explicitly approved and aligned with contract validation. Existing records require inspection before import. |
| P-02 | Reject U+0000 in persisted identity/text input. | PostgreSQL text/JSONB cannot represent it. Do not silently normalize, truncate, or change pure acceptance. The project-name rule already rejects controls. |
| P-03 | Creation capability uses an exclusive actor lock through a restricted function; current grants are separate from immutable grant history. | Agreed correction; effective owner rights, provisioning, and grant-management locks remain #11/#32 work. No global authority singleton. |
| P-04 | Permanent typed operation core plus optional replay payload, with irreversible retirement and fresh-insert enforcement. | Preserve permanent retry identity and exact comparison. Proposed typed columns and atomic shape enforcement require real database tests. |
| P-05 | Relational current configuration plus complete immutable JSONB historical snapshots. | Agreed hybrid direction with explicit ownership. One typed result produces both; reconstruction/drift and historical-codec checks remain required. |
| P-06 | READ COMMITTED with exclusive per-actor creation coordination, restricted locking functions, no Project lock on creation replay, and bounded retry. | Agreed creation direction, not a database-wide default. Function privileges and retry limits require real database tests. |
| P-07 | Replay expires 90 days from the server-recorded operation timestamp, with no additional grace or post-commit adjustment. | Agreed on 2026-10-08; remaining persistence/commit delay is accepted. Sampling, trusted clock, boundary/overflow and compactor behavior require implementation tests. |

Only project creation is represented here. WorkItem, relationship, knowledge,
status-group grant, and archival routes need their own scoped schema changes.
The [B-003 contract](../product/B-003-contract.md) remains the behavioral authority.

## Scalars and permanent operations

Deployment prerequisites are PostgreSQL 16 and database encoding UTF8. The
executable installer provisions separate owner and serving-capability roles.
The integer domain deliberately
uses unconstrained numeric plus an integral-value check: numeric(20,0) can round
fractional input before a CHECK sees it. The adapter must still decode to u64
exactly and reject overflow. Internal generated row IDs may have gaps; they are
not user-visible readable numbers or operation tokens.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA kehila;

CREATE DOMAIN kehila.ident AS text COLLATE "C"
  CHECK (octet_length(VALUE) BETWEEN 1 AND 128);

CREATE DOMAIN kehila.u64 AS numeric
  CHECK (VALUE = trunc(VALUE)
         AND VALUE BETWEEN 0 AND 18446744073709551615);

         AND VALUE ~ '^[!-~]+$');

    OR (target_kind = 'work_item' AND command_family IN
      ('item_create', 'item_edit', 'item_archive', 'item_transition',

);

ALTER TABLE kehila.operations ADD CONSTRAINT slice1_operation_family
  CHECK (command_family = 'project_create');
ALTER TABLE kehila.operations ADD CONSTRAINT slice1_operation_grant
  CHECK (required_grant = 'project_create');

CREATE TABLE kehila.operation_payloads (
  operation_row_id bigint PRIMARY KEY
    REFERENCES kehila.operations(operation_row_id) ON DELETE RESTRICT,
  request_bytes bytea NOT NULL,
  result_codec_version bigint NOT NULL
    CHECK (result_codec_version BETWEEN 1 AND 4294967295),
  result jsonb NOT NULL CHECK (jsonb_typeof(result) = 'object')
);

CREATE INDEX operations_full_expiry
  ON kehila.operations(replay_deadline_ms)
  WHERE NOT payload_retired;
```

The origin/deadline domains reject overflow. replay_origin_ms corresponds to the
pure record's recorded_at_ms: a server timestamp, not a client timestamp or the
future commit instant. Sample it after locks, replay lookup and pure acceptance,
immediately before inserting the accepted persistence batch. Use the same sample
for the deadline and never reset it on replay. The remaining batch/commit delay
is accepted; keep transactions bounded. Prefer the database clock for sampling
and expiry/compaction decisions; verify its mapping and rollback behavior in the
adapter. The permanent original grant is creation permission on actor_id
for this family, checked on every retry. Other grant scopes are not encoded here.
Production request/result codecs and stored-version dispatch must be implemented
before a native command is exposed.

Target fields mirror OperationTarget in the pure contract: a Relationship's
project component is its owner_project_id. NULLS NOT DISTINCT prevents absent
components from admitting duplicate keys. Test all valid shape/family pairs and
rejected extra/missing components. Stored family labels are a proposed mapping;
freeze it with the codec. Expand temporary guards only with the corresponding
command/grant protocol; listing a future family does not implement its route.

The permanent core does not reference a mutable target table. Domain/history
tables reference attributed operations; creation's transaction and reconstruction
prove the created Project exists. Operation retention must not require every
target kind to have a Project FK. This does not approve target erasure or weaken
historical attribution.

Valid scoped keys have at most four 128-byte strings plus family/kind labels;
attribution has two such strings, labels, and a bigint. Validate actual maximum
index tuples on the supported database before enabling this proposed ID limit.
PostgreSQL limits a B-tree entry to approximately one-third of a page after any
applicable compression; do not rely on compressible user input. See
[B-tree limits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/btree-intro.html).

## Atomic payload shape

A committed non-retired operation must have exactly one payload; a retired one
must have none. Enforce this in addition to the payload FK with deferred checks
on both tables. Immediate payload deletion alone would leave ambiguous state.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION kehila.check_operation_payload()
RETURNS trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql SET search_path = pg_catalog, kehila, pg_temp AS $$
DECLARE
  checked_id bigint;
  retired boolean;
  has_payload boolean;
BEGIN
  IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
    checked_id := OLD.operation_row_id;
  ELSE
    checked_id := NEW.operation_row_id;
  END IF;
  SELECT o.payload_retired,
         EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM kehila.operation_payloads p
                 WHERE p.operation_row_id = o.operation_row_id)
    INTO retired, has_payload
    FROM kehila.operations o

```

These shape checks do not protect the replay deadline from premature compaction.
The restricted compactor must lock the core, validate expiry against the reviewed
clock policy, set payload_retired, and delete payload in the same transaction.
Retirement is irreversible even if the clock later moves backward. Replay must
read core/payload coherently; the command protocol must define the locks.

The fresh-insert guard applies to normal serving. Restoration of tombstones
needs a reviewed owner-controlled load procedure and final validation; do not
weaken normal INSERT to accommodate it. TRUNCATE guards protect against mistakes,
not an owner able to disable them. The serving role has no TRUNCATE privilege.
The identity guard rejects payload reassignment before UPDATE; same-identity
updates still undergo the deferred shape check. Serving payload UPDATE remains
forbidden. SP-002 retains its frozen pre-correction schema to reproduce the old
gap and tests this guard separately. The native baseline installs the guard;
it does not yet supply a serving application adapter.

Retirement changes a partial-index column and prevents HOT updates. Measure
compaction batch size, lock waits, WAL and vacuum behavior. The attribution index
is additional storage for composite integrity, not a replacement for the primary
key. No performance bottleneck is established.

## Review and implementation gates

The native foundation follows the selected storage choices in the implementation
plan. Complete domain/interface alignment and production codecs before exposing
a native route. Review upgrades with the seed, attribution, role and command
specifications.
Test direct constraint violations, multi-process retries, premature compaction,
missing payload, clock rollback, restore, and core mutation attempts. Preserve the
explicit trusted function search_path in executable migrations; serving roles
must not own tables or be able to replace functions/triggers.

[SP-002](../spikes/SP-002-postgresql-project-create.md) records bounded native
PostgreSQL evidence for the frozen proposal. It does not establish native
application readiness. Preserve the reproduced payload-identity move failure;
reject moves or check both identities before installing an executable migration.

Owner-controlled repair/import migrations must preserve operation identity and
audit corrections. Define backup, validation, rollback and retention/erasure
rules before real data. Immutability restricts serving writes, not reviewed schema
evolution. Never edit an old successful result to hide a faulty current-state write.
