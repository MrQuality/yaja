# Native PostgreSQL foundation

This is the fresh version-one storage baseline for #26/B-005, following
[ADR-102](../../docs/architecture/ADR-102-postgresql-transactions.md).
It provides permanent operation identity, expiring replay payloads, attributed
project/configuration/history rows and a restricted creation capability.
It does not provide an authenticated native application route or migrate the
existing FerretDB task path. See the [implementation plan](../../docs/implementation/issue-26-postgresql-foundation.md).

## Installation and ownership

Use PostgreSQL 16 with UTF8 encoding in a fresh dedicated database, with normal
durability settings enabled. From the repository root, run
`psql -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f storage/postgresql/install.sql`
as a deployment administrator able to create roles and assume the new owner role.
The installer and all three SQL fragments must remain together. It is tested
using the database superuser; the serving application must never use that account.

Installation is one transaction, including cluster-wide role creation. It fails
on an existing `kehila` schema or either capability role name, unsupported major
version or encoding. Failure rolls back all changes. Reinstallation is rejected;
this is not an upgrade or repair command. Do not drop populated schemas to retry.
Future upgrades require new reviewed migrations and real-data backup/restore
qualification. The two fixed role names require a dedicated role namespace in
the PostgreSQL cluster; this installer cannot provision multiple independent
Kehila databases in the same cluster without a later role-provisioning design.

`kehila_owner` is NOLOGIN and owns the schema, tables and functions.
`kehila_creator` is a separate NOLOGIN capability role with creation INSERT/SELECT,
sequence USAGE, actor SELECT and two restricted locking functions. An administrator
must provision a backend login separately and grant only this capability.
The installer creates no login, credentials or actor records. The creator cannot
administer actors, update/delete grants or replay storage, retire operations,
change history or create objects in kehila. PUBLIC has no schema usage or function
execution in kehila. Database-level CONNECT/TEMP privileges and other schemas
remain deployment configuration. SECURITY DEFINER functions use a fixed trusted
search path.

The backend capability is trusted to persist accepted results. It is not an
end-user permission boundary: actor authentication, permission evaluation and
stable creation-target allocation remain #40/#41 prerequisites. No compactor
capability is granted. An owner can retire payloads structurally, but expiry
authorization, trusted clock behavior and bounded compaction remain adapter work.

## Integrity and representations

`operations.sql` owns scalar domains, typed targets, scoped uniqueness and the
permanent-core/payload guards. A new operation must have one payload at commit;
retirement atomically changes the core flag and removes that payload. Identity
and retirement are irreversible through normal DML. Payload reassignment is
rejected immediately, including privileged updates. TRUNCATE is rejected.

`project_create.sql` owns current relational configuration, checked operation
attribution and deferred membership/current-revision foreign keys.
`access.sql` owns capability grants, locking functions and append-only history
guards. Owners can alter or disable guards; these protect normal DML and mistakes,
not an administrator with schema-changing privileges.

Opaque IDs use C collation, no normalization/trimming, and a 128-byte UTF8 bound.
Tokens use ASCII graphic characters. `u64` is checked integral numeric, avoiding
fractional rounding. These are new native storage rules: align domain/interface
validation and inspect legacy values before exposing native commands or importing
data. Request/result/snapshot columns carry version tags, but SQL does not prove
codec contents, exact M1 seed equality or current/history consistency. The
production adapter must use the single trusted result, reconstruct it inside
the transaction, dispatch stored codecs and preserve the 90-day replay policy.

Primary/unique indexes and the actor-first grant/expiry indexes are installed.
Additional referencing-side indexes listed in the [seed specification](../../docs/architecture/M1-project-create-seed.md)
are deferred until the later mutation/deletion/query paths establish their need.
No load, recovery, backup/restore or production throughput qualification is claimed.

## Disposable native verification

The verifier uses only Podman, Python 3.10+ and the container's `psql`. It supports
Windows and Linux hosts. Ensure at least 3 GiB available host memory after Podman
starts and 2 GiB free disk. Pull the pinned image if it is not already available.
Use a unique container name; the example name is explicitly disposable.
In PowerShell or a Linux shell, run these as individual commands:

```text
podman run -d --name kehila-foundation-test --label purpose=kehila-postgresql-test --network=none --memory=256m --cpus=1 --pids-limit=128 --tmpfs /var/lib/postgresql/data:rw,size=256m -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust docker.io/library/postgres@sha256:0ea6700a3b4f0ae6ce746519073558aed4d88a79d8d07622a9a644946c7319c4 postgres -c listen_addresses=
podman exec kehila-foundation-test pg_isready -U postgres
python scripts/check_postgresql.py --disposable-container kehila-foundation-test
podman rm -f kehila-foundation-test
```

Wait for `pg_isready` to succeed before running the verifier. When choosing an
explicit Podman connection, add `--connection CONNECTION` to each Podman command
and `--podman-connection CONNECTION` to the Python command. Do not mix connections.
Socket trust is restricted to this networkless disposable container; it is not a
deployment authentication configuration. Never point the verifier at a real database.

The verifier checks isolation/resource limits before writing, rejects existing
schemas/roles, injects a pre-COMMIT installation failure and checks full rollback,
installs the baseline, rejects reinstallation, then runs scalar/core/creation and
serving-permission cases. A separate backend connection checks role separation.
It temporarily disables the identity guard inside a transaction: the dedicated
regression must fail, then pass after rollback restores the guard. SQL failures
are fatal; expected failures check SQLSTATE and named constraints where applicable.
Expected verifier-level rejections require psql's script-error exit status 3 and
the actual verbose ERROR SQLSTATE. Optional message checks use the primary error
line. Container/runtime/connection failures and matching text in error context
cannot substitute for a PostgreSQL rejection. The client diagnostic locale is C.
The caller owns container cleanup even when verification fails. Retest with a
fresh container; the verifier never resets an existing schema or drops roles.

This opt-in native check complements `python scripts/verify.py`; the shared
matrix does not start this container or execute the native SQL cases. Frozen
SP-002/SP-003 experiments remain separately reproducible and unchanged.

## Invariant and evidence map

| Invariant | Enforcement | Native verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No partial installation | Single transaction in install.sql | Inject failure after DDL; assert schema and roles absent |
| Exact scalar/key bounds | ident, u64 and operation_token domains | Empty/oversized/multibyte IDs, NUL, fractional/overflow u64, maximum creation key |
| Permanent scoped request identity | operations unique key and core guards | Duplicate key, UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE, fresh retired core rejection |
| One full payload or none when retired | Deferred shape triggers and identity guard | Missing/moved/deleted payload, atomic retirement, guard-removal mutation |
| Exact 90-day stored interval | operations_replay_window | Accept valid interval; reject altered interval; clock enforcement remains adapter work |
| Attributed configuration and ownership | Composite FKs and deferred membership/revision FKs | Wrong operation attribution, missing membership/revision, wrong title owner |
| Append-only creation history | History DML/TRUNCATE triggers and creator ACLs | Owner mutation rejection and serving denial |
| Separate serving authority | Role attributes, ACLs, restricted lock functions | Permitted creation/locks, forbidden administration/DDL, separate login and owner escalation denial |
